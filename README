OVERVIEW:

 This is a double linked list implementation of the IndexedUnsortedList interface.


INCLUDED FILES:

 Required Files for Project:

 * ListTester.java - Driver Class that tests the list
 * IUDoubleLinkedList.java - the double linked list itself
 * DLLNode.java - helper class that defines a multi-directional Node
 * IndexedUnsortedList.java - given interface
 * README - this file


COMPILING AND RUNNING:

 Give the command for compiling the program, the command
 for running the program, and any usage instructions the
 user needs.
 
 These are command-line instructions for a system like onyx.
 They have nothing to do with Eclipse or any other IDE. They
 must be specific - assume the user has Java installed, but
 has no idea how to compile or run a Java program from the
 command-line.
 
 From the directory containing all source files, compile the
 driver class (and all dependencies) with the command:
 $ javac ListTester.java

 Run the compiled class file with the command:
 $ java ListTester
 
 You can also input command line arguments to modify the output:
 -a	Prints all tests
 -s	Just prints the section summaries
 -m	Just prints the Lists by the ToString method
 
 Run the compiled class file with the command:
 $ java ListTester <arg1, arg2, arg3>

 Console output will give the results after the program finishes.


PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:

 Explain the main concepts and organization of your program so that
 the reader can understand how your program works. This is not a repeat
 of javadoc comments or an exhaustive listing of all methods, but an
 explanation of the critical algorithms and object interactions that make
 up the program.
 
 The double linked list uses multi-dimentional nodes which can hold any object.
 These Nodes are linked to the node after and previous to themselves. The last 
 Node of the list is a Dummy-Node. This node acts as a backstop. This addtional Node
 is helpful as it allows some continuity in the creation of the diferent methods. 

 The IUDoubleLinkedList is an implementation of the IndexedUnsortedList interface.
 Additionally, IUDoubleLinkedList relies on the DLLNode class for the functionality of its Nodes.
 ListTester is a testing suite and driver class that tests the DoubleLinkedList functionality of 
 both its ListIterator and its methods.
 
TESTING:

 List tester is a comprehensive testing program that tests the functionality of the 
 IUDoubleLinkedList. It tests all the posibilites from the methods and the tests the
 ListIterator at its varying states.


DISCUSSION:

 This project was quite challanging. I encountered many problems throughout development.
 There were many special cases to consider that I missed on the first attempt. Additionally, 
 building the ListIterator was very difficult. I utilized the debugger to find and solve most 
 of my errors. This was good as I feel like I can use the debugger much more effectivly now.
 Also, my understanding of the concept of an iterator and the linked list was greatly enhanced.
